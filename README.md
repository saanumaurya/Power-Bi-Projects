# Power-Bi-Projects
This project is a Power BI dashboard built using the NCR Ride Bookings dataset. It analyzes ride data from the National Capital Region (NCR) to identify peak demand hours, revenue trends, cancellation patterns, and customerâ€“driver performance. The dashboard helps visualize important metrics such as total rides, booking value, vehicle type.
